**Name:** This is a curated dataset daily that looks at tagged day, new confirmed cases calculated and the ability to easily compare countries or cities.

**Summary:** 
From the Github owner
"I process the COVID-19 data provided by Johns Hopkins CSSE. For World Data, first I split original data by countries. Then I tag the day as day 1 when there are at least 20 confirmed cases in that country. Finally I drop previous days before day 1. For US data, I split original data by states and do the same with threshold 10.

For example:

2020-04-18 US.csv

country: US
date: from 3/2/20 to 4/17/20
confirmed: cumulative confirmed cases in US
deaths: cumulative death cases in US
new_confirmed: new confirmed cases in some day
new_deaths: new death cases in some day
tagged_day: how many days since "day 1", when there are at least 20 confirmed cases in US
2020-04-18 California.csv

state: California
date: from 3/2/20 to 4/17/20
confirmed: cumulative confirmed cases in California
deaths: cumulative death cases in California
new_confirmed: new confirmed cases in some day
new_deaths: new death cases in some day
tagged_day: how many days since "day 1", when there are at least 10 confirmed cases in California
