In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Allen Institute for AI has partnered with leading research groups to prepare and distribute the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a free resource of over 52,000 scholarly articles, including over 41,000 with full text, about COVID-19 and the coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research community.

This dataset is intended to mobilize researchers to apply recent advances in natural language processing to generate new insights in support of the fight against this infectious disease. The corpus will be updated weekly as new research is published in peer-reviewed publications and archival services like bioRxiv, medRxiv, and others.

CORD-19 Explorer is a quick and easy way to search the CORD-19 corpus, and CoViz allows you to discover associations between concepts appearing in the dataset. Or, get started by downloading the complete data below.
