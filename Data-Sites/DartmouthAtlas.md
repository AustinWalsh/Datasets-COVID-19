**Name:** The Dartmouth Atlas - Identifying Regional Populations at High-Risk from COVID-19

**Summary:** 
For more than 20 years, the Dartmouth Atlas Project has documented glaring variations in how medical resources are distributed and used in the United States. The project uses Medicare and Medicaid data to provide information and analysis about national, regional, and local markets, as well as hospitals and their affiliated physicians.

While people of all ages are at risk of becoming ill from COVID-19, subgroups of the population are at particular risk for complications, hospitalization, and death. According to available evidence from patients in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 disproportionately affects older people and those with specific underlying health conditions. In collaboration Dartmouth, CareJourney and Microsoft Healthcare NeXT researchers created an index that measures the fraction of the total population that is considered at particularly high risk: Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 and with at least two of the following chronic diseases: Diabetes, vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. Conditions were identified using chronic condition indicators from the CMS (CMS) Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW). The research team used the most recent data available, 2018 Medicare claims data, along with U.S. Census estimates of the age distribution of the U.S. This novel index may inform public health policy and planning in regions of the country where a spread of COVID-19 might have particularly dire consequences in terms of population health. The data reveal the concentration of highest-risk people, ranging from less than 2% to as much as 22%.
