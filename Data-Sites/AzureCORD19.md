**Name:** Azure CORD-19

**Summary:** 
Full-text and metadata dataset of COVID-19 and coronavirus-related scholarly articles optimized for machine readability and made available for use by the global research community.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Allen Institute for AI has partnered with leading research groups to prepare and distribute the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a free resource of over 47,000 scholarly articles, including over 36,000 with full text, about COVID-19 and the coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research community.

This dataset is intended to mobilize researchers to apply recent advances in natural language processing to generate new insights in support of the fight against this infectious disease.

The corpus may be updated as new research is published in peer-reviewed publications and archival services like bioRxiv, medRxiv, and others.
