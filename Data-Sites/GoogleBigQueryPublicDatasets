**Name:**BigQuery Public Datasets Program

**Summary:** 
In an effort to help combat COVID-19, we created a COVID-19 Public Datasets program to make data more accessible to researchers, data scientists and analysts. The program will host a repository of public datasets that relate to the COVID-19 crisis and make them free to access and analyze. These include the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) dataset, Global Health Data from the World Bank, and OpenStreetMap data.

Free hosting and queries of COVID datasets
As with all data in the Google Cloud Public Datasets Program , Google pays for storage of datasets in the program. BigQuery also provides free queries over certain COVID-related datasets to support the response to COVID-19. Queries on COVID datasets will not count against the BigQuery sandbox free tier , where you can query up to 1TB free each month.

Limitations and duration
Queries of COVID data are free. If, during your analysis, you join COVID datasets with non-COVID datasets, the bytes processed in the non-COVID datasets will be counted against the free tier, then charged accordingly, to prevent abuse. Queries of COVID datasets will remain free until Sept 15, 2020.

The contents of these datasets are provided to the public strictly for educational and research purposes only. We are not onboarding or managing PHI or PII data as part of the COVID-19 Public Dataset Program. Google has practices & policies  in place to ensure that data is handled in accordance with widely recognized patient privacy and data security policies.
