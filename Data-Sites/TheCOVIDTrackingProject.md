**Name:** The COVID Tracking Project

**Summary:** This is an extensive set of data on COVID-19 related items. "All our information comes from state/district/territory public health authorities—or, occasionally, from trusted news reporting, official press conferences, or (very occasionally) tweets or Facebook updates from state public health authorities or governors. We cite all sources in the spreadsheet and discuss the dataset’s constantly fluctuating oddities in the annotations that accompany each state’s data on our website and in the spreadsheet."
