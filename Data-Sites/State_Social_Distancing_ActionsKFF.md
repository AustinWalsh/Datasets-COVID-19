**Name:** State Social Distancing Actions Kaiser Family Foundation

**Summary:** 
On March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus in an effort to enhance the federal government’s response to the pandemic. At that time, a number of states had already declared some type of emergency, and by March 16, 2020, every state had made an emergency declaration, with most taking the form of a State of Emergency or a Public Health Emergency. Such emergency declarations allow governors to exercise emergency powers that may include activating state emergency personnel and funds, supporting the needs of local governments, protecting consumers against price gouging, and adjusting regulations to maximize access to health care. States, especially those hardest hit by the outbreak, took additional actions to slow the spread of the virus. These social distancing measures included mandatory stay at home orders, closures of non-essential businesses, bans on large gatherings, school closures, and limits on bars and restaurants and other public places. With regard to the actions included in this resource, with the exception of school closures, the map and table include only mandates ordered by a state’s executive branch (not state legislature). The authority of governors to issue such mandates may vary by state.

After having social distancing requirements in place for several weeks, states have begun to roll back some of these measures by allowing some or all non-essential businesses to reopen, rescinding stay at home orders, and easing restrictions on in-person dining at restaurants. These actions to ease social distancing requirements will be captured as states implement the changes.
