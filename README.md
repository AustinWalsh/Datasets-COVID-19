**Datasets-COVID-19** <br />

This github repo is designed to make it easier for people to find structured data about COVID-19. All are open to contribute to the resources referenced here. This is meant to serve as a way to easily distribute data and crowdsource available information so informaticists and data scientists can quickly find relevant datasets (structured, semi-structured, natural language, etc).

This repo will is structured as a single master with three main directories: <br />
**Data-Sites** = other websitea and github repos that have data and are maintained. This is simply an index of those available sources.
**Datasets** = This is a point in time pull of data from some of the data-site and referenced. Note this will not be maintained and should mostly be used as a reference to explore data, then retrieve up to date information from the original repo or website to ensure accuracy and citation.
**Interesting-Reads** = this is a bunch of links to articles that discuss working with COVID-19 data. Please feel free to add lists of other titles ad links that people find useful.

Much of the information here is simply presented in a new form from the articles/links cited. Acknowledgements to those who have done the heavy lifting to get the data in place and maintain.
